A.	(Optional)  Set up lm_sensors
	1.	Install lm_sensors on head

	2.	Run "sensors-detect" on head.  Answer yes to set up sensors on head.  
			Run "sensors" to confirm operation

	3.	Run "sensors-detect" again, and DO NOT overwrite config.  
			Script will instead report required modules

	4.	Add specified modules to /etc/warewulf/bootstrap.conf.  
			Rebuild bootstrap image, reboot nodes.

	5.	Run "sensors" on nodes to confirm operation

B.	Setup nodescape
	1.	Pull current nodescape tarball, and unpack to head
	
	2.	Confirm that dynamic_hosts is being provisioned to nodes, 
			and check that it resolves the head's hostname from node
	
	3.	Run the following commands on in screen session on head:
			Launch server on head:
			./nodescape ClusterImages/k[cluster].pgm ClusterImages/b[cluster].ppm
			Run node clients:
			while true; do pdsh -w n[00-XX] ~/NODESCAPE/ClusterScripts/[clusterscript].sh | sort; sleep 10; done;

C.	Troubleshooting:
	1.	"Resource temporarily unavailable"
			Most likely not resolving head hostname.  Check dynamic_hosts
	2.	sensors-detect won't run on nodes!
			Don't, it breaks.  Load modules manually via bootstrap config
